# Overview of the Project

## Project Title
ANALYSIS ON MOVIE REVIEWS

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a sentiment analysis model that classifies IMDb movie reviews as either positive or negative. This model utilizes pretrained GloVe word embeddings for better word representations and LSTM layers to capture the sequential nature of the reviews for enhanced accuracy.

## Key Activities
-**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the movie reviews dataset, tokenizing the text, and padding sequences.
- **Embedding Layer:** Using GloVe pre-trained word embeddings to convert words into meaningful vectors.
- **LSTM Layer:** Incorporating LSTM layers to capture the sequential patterns in movie reviews.
- **Model Training:** Training the model using binary classification techniques to predict whether a review is positive or negative.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optionally fine-tuning hyperparameters such as batch size, number of LSTM units, and learning rate for optimal performance.

## Technology Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the model
  - GloVe: Pre-trained word embeddings
  - Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing
  - Scikit-learn: Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
  - Seaborn/Matplotlib: Visualization of results
- **Tools:**
  - Google Colab: Used for development and training the model
  - GitHub: Version control and code sharing
